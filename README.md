# Role-Based Access Control System (RBAC)

This project implements a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system using **React JS**, **JavaScript**, and a **Mock API** to manage user roles and access permissions. The application allows you to create and manage users, assign them roles, and control their access to resources through a user-friendly interface.

## Demo Links

- [View1 (Vercel)](https://rbac-ui-ebon.vercel.app/)
- [View2 (Render)](https://rbac-system-j4yj.onrender.com/)

## Features
- **User and Role Management**: Create, read, update, and delete users and roles.
- **Access Control**: Assign permissions (Read, Write, Delete) to each user based on their roles.
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform all CRUD operations directly from the UI, without the need for direct database interaction.
- **Mock Data**: Use mock data for users and roles to simulate a real-world backend setup.
- **Interactive UI**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for managing users and their access permissions.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React JS
- **Backend (Mock API)**: JSON Server (using mock data stored in `db.json`)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (for utility-based CSS styling)
- **Hosting**: 
  - Frontend: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and [Render](https://render.com/)
  - Backend: [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. This Application Helps to get Control Access Of User By Interative Feature's & CRUD Operation's.
2. We Uses Mock Data Which Create When New User Automatically Added By Us then next select Access for then.
3. there are [ Write, Read, Delete ] Three Type of Access Controll From Our Side.
4. Using This ABCS you get save min you 60-70% time to interact with data base, because all CRUD are Perform on Direct Using UI [ User Interface ].
5. You Can Get Search Userse Easily.
6. Also get Filter Data Roles Of User's in Roles... [ASC & DSC] -> Both
# and Many More...

## How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rbac-ui.git
cd rbac-ui

2. Install dependencies
Run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies for the project:

bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Run the Mock API Server
To run the mock API server using JSON Server, execute:

bash
Copy code
json-server --watch db.json --port 3001
4. Run the React Development Server
To start the React app, run:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
The app will be accessible at http://localhost:5173.

Features
1. Create Users & Roles
Easily create new users and assign them specific roles such as Admin, Editor, or Viewer.
2. Assign Permissions
Control user access by assigning permissions such as Read, Write, and Delete to each role.
3. CRUD Operations
Create: Add new users and roles.
Read: View users and their roles/permissions.
Update: Modify existing users and roles.
Delete: Remove users and roles.
4. Mock Data
The mock data is stored in db.json, which is served using JSON Server.
Data is automatically created when new users are added, and access controls can be assigned on the fly.
5. Interactive UI
The app features a clean, intuitive interface for managing users and roles.
All CRUD operations can be performed via the UI, reducing the need for backend interaction.
Benefits
Efficient Access Control: Quickly manage user permissions and roles.
No Backend Required: All operations are performed on mock data for demonstration and testing.
Time-saving: Interact directly with the UI to handle CRUD operations, reducing backend overhead.

Future Enhancements
Integration with a real backend (e.g., Node.js with MongoDB or SQL database).
Authentication and user login management.
Role-based UI rendering (show/hide content based on user roles).
